The "Maven Market" project is focused on cleaning, transforming, modeling and visualizing data using Power BI. The project is based on datasets of a “Maven Market” stores network. The original data files .csv collect data from 1997-1998. **Datasets relate to:**

- *assortment*
- *individual stores characteristics*
- *sold items*
- *returned items*
- *customers*
- *regions covered by the MavenMarket store network*

**Following topics were explored:**
- *KPI’s at the end of year 1998*
- *Trending of selected KPI’s over time*
- *Which type of store takes the largest part in total profit of MavenMarket?*
- *What are major socioeconomic characteristics in customers?*
- *How is number of customers trending over time?*
- *Which customers are of a big importance? (amount of money spent/number of transactions)*

**Data was cleaned using Power Query Editor. Examples of functions used:**
- *managing missing values and errors*
- *calculated columns*
- *adding columns from examples*
- *editting data format (date, time, currency, uppercase, extractions...)*
- *adding columns with conditioned values*

**Examples of data transformation strategies:**
- *data categorization*
- *pivot tables*
- *measures using basic DAX language*

**Examples of visual elements used:**
- *using a self-created tooltip*
- *interactive buttons connected to bookmarks/pages*
